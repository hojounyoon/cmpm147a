				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I used the infinite extent of my world to represent another mountain with pink and blue flowers and blue mist shrouding over the land:</p><img src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/03-shutterstock_97696616.jpg" style="width: 500px;"></p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I made the main background color green to show we were in a grassland mountain. I made the pink and blue flowers and little dots and had them scattered. I created an eclipse and had some tiles painted blue to depict the blue mist. From the image's perspective, the mist can make the land be portrayed as blue.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The generated world matches the nature's colors from the photo. The shapes of the flowers and mists seem to be well drawn. Of all the three infinite worlds I created, this one seemed more realistic, so I chose this to be my favorite one</p>
