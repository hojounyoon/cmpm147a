				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:</p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/145a52b3-f3ff-4ad1-8c54-349fb522265f/oceanbeach%2B-%2B9.jpg?v=1744264326971" style="width: 500px;"></p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relation to inspring image:</p>- Color: The colors of the sky, ocean, sand, wet sand, clouds and the houses were sampled from the inspiring image using their respective color codes.</p>- Primitives:</p>The sky, ocean, sand, grey buffer, house base and window are rendered using 'rect' primitives.</p>The wet sand and house roofs are rendered using 'triangle' primitives.</p>The clouds are rendered using 'ellipse' primitives.<br>The waves are rendered using 'arc' primitives.</p>- Polygons: </p>The wet sand triangle is a key polygon that represents sloping or uneven texture.</p>The roofs of the houses contribute to a more realistic portrayal of the scene. </p>The clouds, built from ellipse, form soft, irregular "polygonal" shapes, contributing to the natural aesthetic.</p>- Composition: The objects are arranged with balance. The waves and clouds are randomly placed, adding natural variation, while the wet sand and houses draw attention to the right side of the scene.</p>- Life: The randomn positions of the clouds and waves, along with the presence of the houses and the contrast between dry and wet sand, give the image life. It simulates a realistic beach scene.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
