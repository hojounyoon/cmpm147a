				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This generator was inspired by the idea of collaborative storytelling and the randomness that makes each experience feel unique. In games, books and memes, we often enjoy stories that surprise us or take unexpected turns. This project takes that idea and creates simple, randomized narratives to show the imagination and explore how technology can shape creative expression.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>My goal was to make something playful and approachable - a tool that invites users to keep clicking just to see what comes next. It's a nice introduction to generative design, setting the tone for more complex experiments in the course. This idea was inspired by storytelling games where simple inputs lead to endlessly different outputs.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
